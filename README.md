## Overview
A WebGL-powered visualization of a **4D tesseract** (hypercube) with interactive rotation, a bouncing ball in 4D space, a 3D mini-map, and a legend. The simulation offers an engaging way to explore four-dimensional geometry through projection and animation.

## Features

### Visual Components
- **4D Tesseract Projection**: A real-time 3D projection of a tesseract (4D hypercube) using color-coded edges.
- **Bouncing Ball in 4D**: A simulated ball that moves and reflects within the 4D space.
- **3D Mini-Map**: A small 3D visualization showing the projection of the bouncing ball in (x, y, z).
- **Legend Panel**: A UI legend explaining the color coding of different dimensions.

### Interaction
- **Mouse Rotation**: Drag the mouse to rotate in different 4D planes:
  - Default: Rotates (x,y) and (z,w).
  - Ctrl: Rotates (x,z) and (y,w).
  - Shift: Rotates (x,w) and (y,z).
  - Ctrl + Shift: Applies all transformations.
- **Zooming**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in/out.

### Technical Highlights
- **Canvas-Based Rendering**: Efficient 2D projection using HTML5 `<canvas>` and JavaScript.
- **Perspective Projection**: 4D to 2D projection with depth scaling.
- **Physics Simulation**: Simple bouncing mechanics within a 4D hypercube.
- **Edge Coloring**: Each dimension is color-coded for better visualization.

## Browser Support
- Works on modern desktop browsers with WebGL support.
- **Mobile devices are NOT supported.**
